- The distinct property of DRL programs is learning through trial and error from feedback thatâ€™s simultaneously sequential, evaluative, and sampled by leveraging powerful non-linear function approximation
- Reinforcement learning (RL) is the task of learning through trial and error. In this type of task, no human labels data, and no human collects or explicitly designs the collection of data.
- Deep learning (DL), involves using multi-layered non-linear function approximation, typically neural networks.
