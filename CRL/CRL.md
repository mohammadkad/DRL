### Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL)
- Enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to new tasks, and retain (keep) previously acquired knowledge.
- Exploring methods to enable RL agents to avoid **catastrophic forgetting** and effectively transfer knowledge
- Also referred to as lifelong learning or incremental learning
- The central challenge in CL lies in achieving a balance between **stability** and **plasticity**
- The overarching goal is to build intelligent systems that are capable of learning and adapting throughout their lifetimes, rather than starting anew for each task.
- Current research in CL primarily focuses on two key aspects: addressing 1-**catastrophic forgetting** and enabling 2-**knowledge transfer**.
