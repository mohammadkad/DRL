# DRL
Deep Reinforcement Learning

# Definition
Reinforcement learning is a framework for solving control tasks (also called decision problems) by building agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it through trial and error and receiving rewards (positive or negative) as unique feedback.
In AI, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), a control task refers to a problem where an agent must make sequential decisions to achieve a goal. These are often modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs).
