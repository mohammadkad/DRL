- challenges of training reinforcement learning agents with non-linear function approximators
- represent problems in a way reinforcement learning agents can solve using Markov decision processes (MDP)
- value functions: 
  - The state-value function v(s)
  - The action-value function q(s,a)
  - The action-advantage function a(s,a)
