- The agent’s decision-making process is called the policy π: given a state, a policy will output an action or a probability distribution over actions.
- Our goal is to find an optimal policy π* , aka., a policy that leads to the best expected cumulative reward.

- There are two main types of RL methods:
  - Policy-based methods: Train the policy directly to learn which action to take given a state
  - Value-based methods: Train a value function to learn which state is more valuable and use this value function to take the action that leads to it.
    - we have two types of value-based functions:
      - The state-value function
      - The action-value function
