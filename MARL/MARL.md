### Basics of the fascinating topic of multi-agents reinforcement learning (MARL):
- goal is to create agents that can interact with other humans and other agents.
- When our agent was alone in its environment: it was not **cooperating** or **collaborating** with other agents.
- we have multiple agents that share and interact in a common environment.
- we have multiple agents interacting in the environment and with the other agents.

### Different types of multi-agent environments:
- Cooperative environments: where your agents need to maximize the common benefits.
- Competitive/Adversarial environments: in this case, your agent wants to maximize its benefits by minimizing the opponentâ€™s.
- Mixed of both adversarial and cooperative
